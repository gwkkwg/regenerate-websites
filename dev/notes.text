Where is "cl-html-parse"? Do I update it?




metabang site
  list ASDF packages I maintain too
  improve blurb about contract programming services
  - link to MIT licensed
  Link to STL / expand acronymn
  - link to MOP 
  - link to GNUPlot
  better navigation links

ok - find GPG -> PGP

alts with title
name links (e.g., to mailing list)
width 
several tags out of order? (I think), e.g. A around H3, etc.

-norc  Normally [6]CLISP loads the user [31]"run control" (RC) file on
              startup (this happens after the -C option is processed). The
              file loaded is .clisprc.lisp or .clisprc.fas in the home
              directory [32]USER-HOMEDIR-PATHNAME, whichever is newer. This
              option, -norc, prevents loading of the RC file.

-i init-file
              Specifies initialization files to be [29]LOADed at startup.
              These should be lisp files (source or compiled). Several -i
              options can be given; all the specified files will be loaded in
              order.

lisp-file [ argument ... ]
              Loads and executes a lisp-file, as described in Script
              execution. There will be no [2]read-eval-print loop. Before
              lisp-file is loaded, the variable EXT:*ARGS* will be bound to a
              list of strings, representing the arguments.  The first line of
              lisp-file may start with #!, thus permitting [6]CLISP to be used
              as a script interpreter.  If lisp-file is -, the
              [34]*STANDARD-INPUT* is used instead of a file. If lisp-file is
              the empty string "" or "--", the normal [2]read-eval-print loop
              is entered, and the rest of the arguments is still available in
              EXT:*ARGS*, for parsing by the init function of the current
              memory image. This option must be the last one. No RC file will
              be executed.
